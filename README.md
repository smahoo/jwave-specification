# Z-Wave Command Class Specification File

The J-Wave library contains everything to handle the Command Class Specfications but no specification itself. To use the
library, a specification file is told to be loaded before. Since this specification is open now, this project was generated
that could be used as dependency to load the current version of the Z-Wave Command Class Specification out of the resource. 
 
 
# How to use

Simply load the specification by ```JWaveSpecification.loadDefaultSpecification()```
